            <h>HTML</h>
            <p>Wanting to improve on my website portfolio I knew that the first thing I should start with was the HTML. Reading articles about semantics and the lecture slides and tips that we were taught during our second year at university, I tried my best to rewrite the code as best as I could in order to make my website as compatible as I could get it. I changed some of the class names and removed some of the unnecessary divs. I expanded the navigation adding one more link leading to a brand-new page. I updated the information in the introduction on the home page, changed the portfolio page completely so it matched my vision and made my work easier later on when I was going to add the CSS, left the blog page for last because I wanted to write what I had learned after the whole journey, and created the contact me page. Starting to rebuild the portfolio page I thought it would be best if I displayed my projects in a simpler and cleaner way, instead of just a block of text describing it. I wrote what the project name was, the point of it, the languages that I had used in order to create them and added an image showing how it looks like.
            </p>
            <h>CSS</h>
            <p>• Mobile approach All of the CSS was written via a mobile-first approach and was afterward changed via media queries for tablet and desktop sized screens. • The Stylesheet While writing the CSS I was constantly going back to the style I had drawn during the planning phase. I had a couple of websites that inspired me and I had combined all the elements I liked from them in one website. The main idea of the pen and paper style was to aim, develop and design things that were not yet in my skill set in order to improve and learn. I also wanted to make the user experience as best as I could and wanted everything to make sense. On paper, I had the idea for the main color scheme to be gray with light-rainbow color accents on specific parts. But after playing around with the colors I found a better way to use the rainbow color scheme. I made an animated fluid change of colors on the heading and started searching for the perfect background. I noticed how some people use opacity in order to mask the background image and make the text on the top to pop up, so that was what I did. I wanted to make the viewer look at the greeting first and used a bit of "empty" space on top and bottom of it, although I did not see the need of so much space on the other pages of the website because they did not have the same purpose. • Desktop approach Coming from mobile first to a desktop I wanted to keep up the readability of the paragraphs, so I decided to give the main content a maximum width of 50% which later on became 60 for visual purposes. I adjusted the size of the text, the headings, and the navigation as well. • The Animations All the animations except the header rainbow followed the research by Val Head presented in this article. • Contact me button I decided to put a contact me button on every page because I wanted to allow the user to feel free to contact me from any page with any subject and anything in particular that perhaps interested, inspired or made them disagree with my vision and skill set.
            </p>
            <h>JavaScript</h>
            <p>While planning on how to create the contact me page so it had a message system I did not know how to code it and instead I just found an automated system that required a link to a JavaScript page that I could not get the hang around and could not figure out how to code it myself so I just used theirs. When I added the "back to top" button I wanted to make it so it appears after a scroll down or two so I searched on how that could be achieved and fell on this article, which made me change my initial idea fully. The example button they have was initially on the right but I wanted to change it to appear on the left side because most of the phone users are right handed and while holding a phone with your right hand it is easier to click what is further left rather than closer to your arm.
            </p>
            <h>Logo</h>
            <p>After finishing the site I wanted to make my logo blend in with everything and be a part of the website. I opened it with Ai and smoothened the edges, changed the colors and saved it for the web. I created a "favicon" version of it so it can be displayed near the title. The idea of the logo is that it represents my initials in quite simple but creative way. The "i" Is a representing a pencil that is conveniently drawing the second letter of my initials "s".

            <h>09/14/2017 MAKE ME STAND OUT IN FRONT OF EMPLOYERS!!!!!</h>
            <h>HTML</h>
            <p>Not much was changed on the HTML part of the website, only a couple of adjustments on divs and sections.</p>
            <h>CSS</h>
            <p>• The Navigation on a single page layout When I decided on the design to be a single page layout I drew a couple of sketches and gathered the best of my ideas in one, then got to work. I decided to change the navigation to be fixed on the top part of the screen for ease of use. I didn't want the user to click twice (once on the "back-to-top" button and once on a navigation item) in order to go where they wanted. I also did not want to add the navigation to multiple parts of the website. • The body Headings "the section brakes" The headings in the previous version of the website was taking too much space as well. I needed to implement them in such a way that they still let the user know which section of the website they were on and I needed to make that as compact as possible. I figured out that the headings need to relate to the navigation list colors and put pictures that set a tone for the upcoming section. • Portfolio redesign The initial portfolio layout was taking too much space for that much information. It was supposed to complement the pictures but they were not as promising as they should have been. That made me reconsider on how I should present my projects. The main idea was to simplify it and so I did by removing the images and shrinking the "project-boxes". I have them different colors so they can contrast one another and set the text color to white with a bit of shadow (specific to each box) so it could be easily readable on each box background color. I gave the boxes a nice "hover over" change in the opacity so it made a contrast to the viewer where their mouse is. And lastly, I replaced the paragraph of text that explained what languages I had used with simple icons for CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript and for the PHP icon I needed to make my own icon to match the other ones. • Form design For the form, I wanted a clean, simple and matching design that attracted the reader's attention just enough to let him know where he can contact me with any message.
            </p>
            <h>JavaScript</h>
            <p>In the initial design of the website, there was a bit of jQuery added to make the "back-to-top" button work properly. I learned what exactly made the back to top button to appear and figured out that I can use the same lines of code (which on a scroll, added a class to a specific element) to make the navigation, which was fixed on the top, change its font size and background. With the same lines of code, I figured out that I can make paragraphs fade in on while the user was scrolling to make it appear smoother. Then I added the "smooth scroll transitions all around" which got every single hash "#" in the code and made the transitions between one another smooth. The last couple of lines of jQuery were supposed to make the navigation be position aware but the functions I found either did not work for me or I didn't understand how to implement them. Instead, I used the previous function that added a class on a certain pixel scroll and made each navigation list underlined if the user's window was scrolled on its content.

                <h>The Spark that made me change it</h>
                <p>When the website was finished, according to the primal design I had planned, I ended up with a four-page layout, perfectly adaptable for mobile and tablet, containing everything I wanted it to have back then. However, that was only using the coding knowledge I already had. And so I started learning and using new lines of code, read articles on css-tricks.com and others about animation timing and proper use of jQuery. I decided to change the layout of the website to be on a single page because I saw no need for a single form to be on a separate page. The other pages did not require that much either and instead came the idea to make it a single page layout.
